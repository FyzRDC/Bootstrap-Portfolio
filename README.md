# Why ?

For School, I have a Portfolio to do using Bootstrap, so I decided to challenge me a bit and to add some of my personal competences !

# How ?

Using ExpressJS, JWT, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Whirl, dotenv and many more.

Don't forget to create a .env file at root with this template :

```yml
DATABASE = 
DATABASE_HOST = 
DATABASE_USER = 
DATABASE_PASSWORD =
JWT_SECRET = 
```
